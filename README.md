# Dummy science tool

This is a simple CLI tool which doesn't do anything useful.
"Why does it exist then?", I hear you ask!

For a Python course which teaches how to write scripts which interact with external programs.
I need a tool which can be installed and run which simulates running some scientific process.
I want it to be opaque as we will be writing a Python wrapper around it to automate its use.
